# motion_detector
This is a python based motion detector using (Opencv module) 


# Library Used ->
1. pandas
2. Opencv 
3. datetime


# Basic Idea: 
     With the use Opencv I just capture the first frame when program start exectution and when it captures it then if any object comes into frame, then i put an object in a rectangular box and where ever in the frame it goes we just had a rectangular box on it.
     
     with the use of datetime module I just note the time when an object comes into a frame and when it is leaving our frame.
     
     with the use of pandas module I just append the time which is given by the datetime module into an excel file(.xls) .
     
# This project covers many class and fuctions of Opencv and also has many applications in the field of home security and at different securities, if it gets integrated with raspberry pi .
